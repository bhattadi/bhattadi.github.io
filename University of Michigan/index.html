          <h2 style="text-align: left;">Why U of M:</h4>
          <p>
            Making the choice of which college to attend depends on a variety of 
            factors: program strength, cost, geography, and more. I myself was not 
            sure as to what I wanted to do in the future. In fact, even today I don't 
            know what I will be doing 10 years from now. I chose to go to U of M 
            because of its highly ranked Computer Science Department but also a
            combination of location, traditional college experience, and future opportunity.
            <br><br>
            In terms of location, U of M is in the Midwest but still in the Eastern Time 
            Zone. Therefore, it is easy to communicate with my family as they live in 
            New Jersey. Additionally, I enjoy the cold breeze and an environment where sweaters
            and black jeans can be considered the norm. While many disagree, I enjoy the adventures
            that the cold wintery environment Michigan provides. 
            <br><br>
            Every school has some sort of specialty. Whether it be technology, medicine, business,
            or a party school, every University is known as some symbol. The Symbol that U of M 
            represents is well-rounded. The School is ranked 3rd by USNEWS as the best Public School
            in the country with top 10 ranked Engineering, Business, and Medicine Programs. Along with 
            academics, U of M has one of the best Division I Football and Basketball Programs making
            it a feeder school for top athletes and brilliant students. Bringing these two types of students
            creates a positive atmosphere where students are truly pushed to be the best versions of themselves
            academically but also the happiest versions of themselves.
            <br><br>
            I have never seen a school provide as many resources and events for Career Opportunities as
            U of M has. The school has hundreds of advisors who are ready to be contacted in person or 
            virtually to help plan courses, provide resume critique, or any type of guidance. The school
            sends many, many students to top companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, 
            Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Tesla, and many more for full time opportunities,
            internships, and Co-ops. I am thankful that the schools connections makes it fairly easy to land
            interviews at virtually any company.
            <br><br>
            Because of these reasons, I have never doubted my decision to go to Michigan. While the life is 
            significantly different than the pace of living near New York City, it is a very valuable one
            filled with intelligent minds from all across the world.
